abosolute - is to use file with instructions as key
if key in memory then depth is common for every bit
depth is changeable
otherwise depth is different and max depth can be configured 
or even make it interactive( if program cant use -1 iterations
then it will ask for a limit for one bit ( for example when both operations are shift rows))
but if the key is file person should enter seconds one-time key or use gen-key for ciphering
add justifying text in order to make its len equal to some num in square
and add grid size
